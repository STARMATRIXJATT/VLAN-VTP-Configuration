# VLAN-VTP-Configuration
Mastering VLANs & VTP in Cisco Packet Tracer 🚀
I recently worked on a networking project where I implemented VLANs and VTP (VLAN Trunking Protocol) to efficiently manage and propagate VLANs across multiple switches. This setup ensures network segmentation, security, and scalability in a multi-switch environment.
Project Overview 🌐
📌 Objective: Create multiple VLANs and propagate them dynamically across all switches using VTP.
📌 Tools Used: Cisco Packet Tracer
📌 Key Technologies: VLANs, VTP, Trunking, Inter-VLAN Routing
Implementation Steps 🛠️

✅ Step 1: Configure VLANs on the Core Switch (VTP Server)

vtp domain MyNetwork
vtp mode server
vtp version 2
vtp password Cisco123

vlan 10
 name Sales
vlan 20
 name IT
vlan 30
 name HR

✅ Step 2: Configure VTP Clients on Other Switches

vtp domain MyNetwork
vtp mode client
vtp password Cisco123

✅ Step 3: Enable Trunking for VLAN Communication

interface FastEthernet 0/1
switchport mode trunk
switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20,30

✅ Step 4: Assign IPs to VLAN Interfaces for Management & Routing

interface vlan 1
ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
no shutdown
interface vlan 10
ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0

✅ Step 5: Verify Configuration

Key Learnings & Benefits 💡
🔹 Centralized VLAN management with VTP Server
🔹 Efficient VLAN propagation across all switches
🔹 Secure and scalable network design
🔹 Seamless communication between VLANs using trunk ports
🚀 This was a great hands-on experience in network segmentation and switching technologies! Looking forward to applying these concepts in real-world enterprise networking.
